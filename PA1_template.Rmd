## Loading and preprocessing the data

This is an R Markdown document for Reproducable Research - Course Project 1. We start by reading the file into R and formatting it.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
    activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/Nehash/OneDrive/Data Science Specialization/Reproducable Research/repdata-data-activity/activity.csv")
    activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

Next step is to load Dplyr package in R

```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide"}
  library("dplyr", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.1")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r, echo = TRUE}  
  activity <- group_by(activity, date)
  daily_step_summary <- summarise(activity, sum = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))

  hist(daily_step_summary$sum, xlab = "Total steps taken per day", main = paste("Histogram of" ,  "total number of steps taken each day"))
  mean(daily_step_summary$sum)
  median(daily_step_summary$sum)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r, echo = TRUE}  
  activity <- group_by(activity, interval)
  daily_interval_summary <- summarise(activity, avg = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
  
  plot(daily_interval_summary$interval, daily_interval_summary$avg, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average", main = "Time series plot of interval and the average steps taken")
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r, echo = TRUE}  
  sum(is.na(activity$steps))
  activity_copy <- activity
  indx <- which(is.na(activity_copy$steps), arr.ind=TRUE)
  activity_copy$steps[indx] <- mean(activity_copy$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  activity_copy <- group_by(activity_copy, date)
  daily_step_summary_copy <- summarise(activity_copy, sum = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
  hist(daily_step_summary_copy$sum, xlab = "Total steps taken per day", main = paste("Histogram of" ,  "total number of steps taken each day - NA REPLACED"))
  mean(daily_step_summary_copy$sum)
  median(daily_step_summary_copy$sum)
```
## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r, echo = TRUE}  
  
  activity_weekday_test <- activity_copy
  activity_weekday_test$date <- as.Date(activity_weekday_test$date)
  weekdays1 <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
  activity_weekday_test$wDay <- c('weekend', 'weekday')[(weekdays(activity_weekday_test$date) %in% weekdays1)+1L]
  activity_weekday_test_1 <- activity_weekday_test
  Weekday <- filter(activity_weekday_test_1, wDay == "weekday")
  Weekend<- filter(activity_weekday_test_1, wDay == "weekend")
  group_by(Weekday, interval)
  group_by(Weekend, interval)
  Weekday_Summary <- summarise(Weekday, avg = mean(steps))
  Weekend_Summary <- summarise(Weekend, avg = mean(steps))
  Weekday_Summary <- mutate(Weekday_Summary, Weekday = "Weekday")
  Weekend_Summary <- mutate(Weekend_Summary, Weekday = "Weekend")
  Summary_Week <- bind_rows(Weekday_Summary,Weekend_Summary)
  
  library(ggplot2)
  Sum_Week <- Summary_Week
 #P <- qplot(interval, avg, data = Sum_Week, facets = Weekday ~., geom = "line", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
  
  
```
